  		<h1 style="margin-top:4em;">Apploi Mobile 2.0</h1>
  			

  			<p>The business challenge was to rethink <a href="http://Apploi.com" target="_blank">Apploi</a>'s job search app and improve its information architecture while increasing engagement and repeat usage.</p>

			<p>The outcome sought in this project is to create a job app that people would enjoy using at a higher delta than existing players, be able to use anywhere, and do most of the work for them so all they have to do is to get to answering employer questions, which exponentially increases the likelihood of getting a job.</p>

			<h2>FIRST PRINCIPLES EXERCISE</h2>

			<p>From a product perspective, my process usually starts with “first principles thinking” which is breaking down the assumptions of the status quo. In this case, the questions that surfaced were:</p>

			<ul class="para">
				<li>What is a job?</li>
				<li>What is a job application?</li>
				<li>What does job search entail?</li>
				<li>What do people “hire” existing job apps for?
				<li>What makes people come back?</li>
				<li>What is a successful job application?</li>
				<li>Should it be network?</li>
				<li>What is the user’s investment?</li>
				<li>How do we provide variability for them to use it again and be of value?</li>
			</ul>

			<p>The main insight that came from this exercise was, at least in this particular demographic of hourly work, the problem with regular “job search” is that most people don’t know what to look for, or essentially where to begin. Therefore, Apploi has to make this as frictionless as possible, almost like we’re holding their hand and being a guide in their journey to more success.</p>

			<p>If this is the case, the focus should be:</p>

			<ol class="olist">
				<li>Surfacing relevant jobs and companies (and as many helpful details as possible—compensation, distance, hours, work culture, etc.)</li>
				<li>Creates a “progress journal” of sorts.</li>
				<li>Users being able to apply fast and in a meaningful way, and not go through the bloated, long, and usually no feedback application process.</li>
			</ol>

			<p>One of my strongest convictions is that products should have an opinion, and as designers and product people, we do our job right when we inch it closer to an ideal world through the things that we’re building. In this case, it’s obviously a tall order, but if we can communicate the benefits to both job seekers and employers, we create a healthier ecosystem which would propel higher supply and demand densities.</p>

			<h2>DISSECTING THE STATUS QUO</h2>

			<p>The standard model of job apps had these factors:</p>

			<ol>
				<li>Old-fashioned search</li>
				<li>Confusing parameters</li>
				<li>Hard to delineate 3rd party jobs from employers that actually used Apploi enterprise dashboard</li>
				<li>Convoluted application process</li>
				<li>Relies on old “currency” which is resume/cover letter</li>
			</ol>

			<p>Our main challenge is to move away from this and create an app that will eventually be an order of magnitude better than the existing players, as Slack did for team communication.</p>

			<p>New models that were interesting:</p>

			<ol>
				<li>Nuzzel/Foursquare model that surfaces recommendations based on the initial data set the user gives, and learns from user behavior overtime</li>
				<li>An onboarding that creates a user identity which would make their search and application process much easier and faster</li>
				<li>Granular search filters (which get better overtime as we get more data from employers)</li>
				<li>Core value proposition:</li>
   					<ul style="font-size:1em">
   						<li>The easiest way to apply to jobs on mobile</li>
    					<li>Hiring the human way</li>
    					<li>Puts the human back in HR</li>
    				</ul>
				<li>Gives job seekers detailed information on what the employing store/company is like</li>
			</ol>
