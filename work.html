				<img src="assets/photos/ThirtyMadison.png">

				<h4 class="experience">Thirty Madison</h4>

				<p class="year">2021 - 2022</p>

				<h5 class="dek">I was the Design Lead & Group Manager for <a href="https://thirtymadison.com/" target="_blank">Thirty Madison</a>'s Launch Team, architecting its centralized system and mobile applications.</h5>

				<p>I was hired by Thirty Madison as a consultant through my company <a href="http://feeleternity.com" target="_blank">Feel Eternity</a> to help strategize, design, and build the foundations of Central App, its universal design system that will allow it to build entirely new brands and scale new products and features with minimum development effort.</p>
				
				<p>This involved creating its multibrand component library, the design token architecture, and its entire end-to-end consumer journey from conversion all the way to retention. This is a technically complex undertaking connecting dozens of microfrontends, services, and a front-end layout engine that sets up the foundation of Thirty Madison to be a multi-brand, multi-condition, multi-business-model healthcare platform for years to come.</p>

				<p>During this process, I helped launch <a href="https://facet.thirtymadison.com/" target="_blank">Facet</a>, Thirty Madison's new skincare brand, as the first brand to be built entirely through Central App, and re-joined full-time as design lead and group design manager across all of Launch's engineering teams and the principal designer for its mobile team.</p>

				<p>I helped architect its entire front-end stack and designed future products from high-level strategy, down to the smallest of pixels and ushered features across both web and mobile all the way through engineering implementation.</p>

			<img src="assets/photos/Cove.png">

			<h4 class="experience">Cove by Thirty Madison</h4>

				<p class="year">2020-2021</p>

I was the first in-house product designer and design manager leading all design efforts in conversion, retention, and partnerships.</h5>

				<p>I led all design in consumer features such as "Build Your Plan", the initial recommendation quiz for prospective patients, the online medical consultation, quarterly patient check-ins, and many more.</p>

				<p>I also streamlined and modernized the design system, helped optimize the design-to-engineering pipeline across new features and system improvements like React Storybook and the design QA process, started the design team, and led quarterly design strategy & planning.</p>

				<h4 class="experience">Condé Nast</h4>

				<p class="year">2016-2019</p>

				<h5 class="dek"><a href="https://www.condenast.com" target="_blank">Condé Nast</a> owns 20+ of the most-renowned media brands in the world with an audience of 120+ million across 32 markets. I designed many digital products, several new million-dollar digital businesses, led design & engineering teams, and helped create Verso, its global design system now used by product development teams worldwide.</h5>

				<h6>Verso Team Design Lead</h6>

				<p>In 2019, I became the team lead for the entire Verso Design System, leading design, strategy, & operations for all system-wide and brand-specific design work, was a key decision-maker for the design org on where and how to deploy resources while partnering with other stakeholders outside tech organization.</p>

				<p>I continued to design a lot of concepts from a component and page perspective, helped build the user account pages for our subscription brands, while managing all delivery and leading a team of designers.</p>

				<h6>AD Pro</h6>

				<p>Also in 2019 and in parallel with being team lead, I worked with Architectural Digest to create <a href="https://www.architecturaldigest.com/adpro" target="_blank">AD Pro</a>, a member-only publication for the interior design industry. I designed purchase flows, different content experiences, new system components for their content strategy, and led product for the engineering team in delivery of the front-end: roadmap, creating all user stories, assesing design system tradeoffs, and creating the CMS logic to curate the new sub-brand.</p>

				<p class="caption"><strong>Deliverable</strong>: Brand new website with new components, new templates (channels, account management, etc.), new business model (B2B subscription) working on top of the Verso design system. Visual design by Adrian Harwood.</p>


				<h6>Verso Homepages</h6>

				<p>In 2018, I led design for the Homepages team, which created all Discovery components (40+) and variations (120+) to be used on all Condé Nast websites, and helping architect customization (styling configurations, responsive behavior, aspect ratios, template logic) as well as how to operate it in our content management system. We launched the pilot for <a href="https://www.glamour.com/" target="_blank">Glamour</a>, <a href="https://www.teenvogue.com/" target="_blank">Teen Vogue</a>, and <a href="https://www.them.us/" target="_blank"><em>them</em></a>.</p>

				<h6>Design System Website + User Journey Map</h6>

				<p>In 2018, Condé Nast went through a re-org to consolidate all its product development efforts with a global design system to be created named Verso. Being that I worked on the initial pitch for this called Experience Platform back in 2016, my first project was on the private documentation website and pattern library built on Gatsby.</p>

				<!-- <img src="assets/photos/work/mvp_documentation_site.png">
				<p class="caption">Designed a lightweight and minimal documentation site on Gatsby that acted as a source of truth of the yet-to-be-named design system while it was being built.</p> -->

				<p>I also worked on a user journey template for teams to use when creating new products for the various brands.</p>

				<!-- <img src="assets/photos/work/CN_UserJourney_2.png"> -->
				<p class="caption">An adaption of the hook model that is tailored to Condé Nast's business model and offerings.</p>


				<h6>Golf Digest Schools</h6>

				<p>Mid-2018, I worked on Golf Digest again to create <a href="https://www.golfdigest.com/schools" target="_blank">Golf Digest Schools</a>—a subscription-based video instruction portal for golfers. After months of strategy, research, design, and prototyping, we launched a successful new business and major revenue stream for the brand, becoming a major factor in its sale to Discovery, Inc.</p>

				<h6>GQ Photo Galleries</h6>

				<p>In early 2018, I worked on GQ to help design the Galleries product to huge success: +100% completion rates, +45% click-through rate, +14% in new revenue generated, and created new sponsorship models to help the sales team sell entirely new units and bundles to brand advertisers like Gucci, Cartier, Bottega Veneta and others.</p>

				<p>This was a pivotal win that it became the foundation for all product and photography galleries and was eventually ported over to all Condé Nast websites.</p>

				<img src="assets/photos/GQ_Galleries_1.png">
				<p class="caption">New features include a cinematic feel on both web and mobile, multiple image slide, sponsor content units, affiliate products, immersive recirculation units.</p>

				<h6>GQ Best Stuff Newsletter</h6>

				<p>I also worked on the GQ Best Stuff newsletter, which was featured on Digiday, as GQ was ramping up its e-commerce efforts.</p>

				<img src="assets/photos/work/GQ_BestStuffNewsletter_4.png">

				<p>After doing extensive UX work, prototyping, and high output projects, I was promoted to senior designer.</p>



				<h6>Golf World</h6>

				<p>In 2017, I worked on <a href="https://www.golfdigest.com/" target="_blank">Golf Digest</a> helping revive the Golf World brand (the oldest golf magazine in existence) and strategize its audience funnel, eventually leading to the creation of millenial sports brand <a href="https://www.golfdigest.com/the-loop" target="_blank">The Loop</a>.</p>

				<h6>BRIDES Redesign + Experience Platform</h6>

				<p>In 2016, I joined the team as a designer as the company was growing out its digital design team. I first started working on the BRIDES redesign focusing on its wedding inspiration product, then piloted a concept for a global design system called Experience Platform.</p>

				<img src="assets/photos/Brides_1.png">

I worked there as a product designer building consumer and enterprise apps for both web and mobile.</h5>

				<p>In 2015, I joined to help on a major redesign of their app used by hiring managers to post listings, create online questionnaires, and assess the hiring pool.</p>

				<img src="assets/photos/work/Apploi_Truman2.png">
				<p class="caption">Can see listed jobs and candidates who applied at a glance and can see how far along they are in the process.</p>

				<p>Then I helped create a new end-to-end online application system for hourly jobs, increasing quality leads for hiring managers and potential for landing a job for applicants.</p>

				<img src="assets/photos/work/Apploi_Churchill.png">
				<p class="caption">Applicants can pre-fill with their existing resume, answer questionnaires via video/audio responses, and add times that would be ideal for them to work.</p>

				<p>I also designed a hypercontextual mobile app that focused on geo-location and asynchronous video interviews.</p>

				<p class="caption">Hypercontextual job app that focused on key industries, travel time, and allowed 1-tap to apply with already existing profile and resume.</p>
