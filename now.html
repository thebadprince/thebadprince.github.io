  		<h2>Currently</h2>
  				<p>My main objective: learn how to fully build a product from scratch, from strategy, to design, and all the way to implementation.</p>

  				<p>While I'm versed in the first two, forcing myself to work more in code and not just in paper, pixels helps me jump out of my comfort zone and work my vision faster. At the same time, building a product from scratch lets me dig deeper and explore new interface possibilities and extend my visual design skills and widen my protoyping range.</p>

  				<p>To help with this, I'm doing the <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/en/learn/web" target="_blank">Full-Stack Web Development</a> track via <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/en/learn/web" target="_blank">Codecademy Pro</a> and learning how to build a Swift app using <a href="https://designcode.io/" target="_blank">Design+Code</a>.<p>

  				<p>Other than that, I'm trying to <a href="https://www.calm.com/" target="_blank">meditate</a> and <a href="http://dayoneapp.com/" target="_blank">journal</a> for 30 straight days (for starts). I'm also doing a modified <a href="http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/mike-ohearn-power-bodybuilding-12-week-program.html" target="_blank">powerbuilding program</a> to build on my strength and retain muscle. My diet is on maintenance until I get the hang of my design-in-code objective. For the meantime, my goal is to get back to form and comfortably deadlift 315lbs, squat 225 lbs, and bench 135 lbs on reps.</p>

  				<p>I'll try to update this page every month from here on out.</p>
