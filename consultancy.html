			<h3 class="lede">I help software teams <em>build the future</em> through strong product vision, strategy, and design.</h3>

			<p>I’m a product development consultant experienced in <strong>product management, product design, business strategy, and operations.</strong> I’ve worked in various team sizes, product categories, business models, and technical stacks. I’ve taken <a href="/work.html">many products</a>—in both web and mobile, consumer and enterprise, ranging from zero to millions of users—from concept to validation to launch to scale.</p>

			<br/>

			<h3>The key is creating <em>the right environment</em> where great products can be built as a result of a <em>strong vision</em> combined with <em>strong systems</em> in place.</h3>

			<p>Outside of the most obvious things, what is right for one product or company is rarely right for another. <strong>If you’re just systematically copying what someone else is doing or how they did it, you cannot create any meaningful separation.</strong> This is why it’s crucial to develop your own strategy that is right for you and unique to your company, and a way of doing and thinking about things right for your stage and congruent with your values and mission.</p>

			<p>You have to figure out what success means for your company, and what a great product would be that aligns with your version of success, and how to uniquely capture value in return.</p>

			<p>This is where I come in: <strong>I can help formulate a strategy, define the right target metrics, translate it to a particular product vision down to the smallest details, and execute on it methodically—with precision & quality—with your team to reach your goals.</strong></p>

			<br/>

			<h2>What I Can Do</h2>

			<img src="assets/photos/vision_velocity.png">

			<!-- ## I help startups feel as *robust* as mature teams, and mature teams to feel as *nimble* as startups. -->

			<h3>I help teams navigate chaos, create separation, and feel grounded while moving swiftly.</h3>

			<p>Below are some examples of what I can do for your team depending on size and specific need:

			<table style="width:100%">
				  <tr>
				    <th><strong>For Startups</strong></th>
				    <th><strong>For Mature Teams</strong></th>
				  </tr>
				  <tr>
				    <td>Nail down go-to-market strategy</td>
				    <td>Explore new areas of opportunity</td>
				  </tr>
				  <tr>
				    <td>Be the first product/design lead</td>
				    <td>Expand product feature set</td>
				  </tr>
				  <tr>
				    <td>Establish initial product & design practice</td>
				    <td>Define multi-phased product strategy with leadership</td>
				  </tr>
					<tr>
				    <td>Build the first product with the engineering team</td>
				    <td>Refine end-to-end product development process</td>
				  </tr>
					<tr>
				    <td>User research & testing for new products</td>
				    <td>Lead product for a development team</td>
				  </tr>
					<tr>
				    <td>Build early-stage design team</td>
				    <td>Lead product, design, and/or operations</td>
				  </tr>
			</table>

			<br/>

			<h2>Process</h2>

			<img src="assets/photos/createflow7.png">

			<h3>Building the future is about doing the right things and doing things right. When you have both of these, you have <em>flow</em>.</h3>

			<p>How I accomplish this:</p>

			<ol class="beliefs">
			<li>I fully <strong>IMMERSE</strong> myself in the reality of your business, the stage of your organization, your company’s market, and your team’s specific challenges.</li>
			<li>I <strong>IMAGINE</strong> what a better future would be for your organization, figuring out the few most critical, highest leverage moves that can be made with the resources at your disposal, and what specific things your team can do to get there, with my assistance.</li>
			<li>I <strong>INTEGRATE</strong> myself fully into your current system and find crucial areas of improvement and start to shift things tactically to move towards the desired future state.</li>
			<li>I get <strong>INVOLVED</strong> in the day-to-day operations where necessary, rolling my sleeves and working directly with anyone I have to, from the CEO to the most junior person.</li>
			</ol>

			I will never claim to know your business better than you do. But with my help, you will find out some things you didn’t know about <strong>how your business currently runs</strong> and <strong>how to make it run much better</strong>.

			<br/>

			<h2>Unfair Advantage</h2>

			<img src="assets/photos/ste.png">

			<p>I have a <a href="/philosophy.html">strong philosophy</a> built from building and designing products myself. My direct experience has given me the ability to analyze things from a <strong>combination of the user, the business, and the technology</strong> behind it, as well as other parts fundamental in shipping a quality product.</p>

			<p>I work as seamlessly with leadership as I do with designers, engineers, and other core stakeholders and contributors. I can go high-level crafting a business’s multi-year strategy, to figuring out the right product to build the next quarter, which features to prioritize the next sprint, all the way to getting my hands dirty with design tools, a code editor, and a terminal if I have to. <strong>I ship product.</strong></p>

			<p>I have a genuine respect and profound curiosity for <strong>the entire product development process</strong> instead of just a single practice, allowing me to see things from a higher level but still have direct competency with each function (strategy, design, engineering, data, marketing, sales, etc.).</p>

			<p>My biggest edge, however, is my <strong>energy</strong>. I have an infectious personality driven by challenge and a hunger for excellence. I take pride in doing whatever it takes to win: there is no skill I can’t or won’t learn, or task that’s above or beneath me if push comes to shove. I love working with talented people to do things we couldn’t otherwise do alone. One of the best things about the job for me is being able to learn and teach and grow with others.</p>

			<p>Building technology with a humanistic lens is my calling. I treat the craft extremely seriously, while also having a lot of fun in the process.</p>

			<!--<strong>All projects have a one-month minimum with a flat hourly rate.<strong> -->

			<h2>Let’s Build</h2>

			<p>I like to work <strong>in-house and face-to-face</strong> to develop strong rapport with teams, preferably within the New York metro area. But also available for remote work and travel depending on project need.<p>

			<!-- I’ve seen what works and what doesn’t work. That said, I also know <strong>every situation is unique<strong> and there are no silver bullets, only strong desire, conviction, passion, and will to figure it out with other driven people. -->

			<hr>

			<strong>Sidenote:</strong> I also give lectures to students, from elementary all the way to graduate, and speak with underrepresented groups about technology. Pending availability, I’m happy to do these as well. Feel free to reach out.
