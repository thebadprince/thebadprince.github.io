  		<h1 style="margin-top:4em;">Apploi Enterprise Dashboard 2.0</h2>

  			<div class="thesis">Modernizing an enterprise dashboard used by hiring managers and business owners to post jobs and find the right candidates in a faster, smarter, and more effective way.</div>

  			<p>The business challenge was to completely revamp the user experience, simplicity, and visual design of the prior dashboard to make it vastly more appealing and easier to use for current and existing users. If we were to succeed, Apploi’s client-side product would just be as convenient to use by a hiring manager who’s operating it on their own for the first time in order to get a few applicants for a single role, as it is by an enterprise client with a regional HR team who has hundreds of applicants for a variety of positions.</p>

  			<p>Our goal as a team was to create and implement a scalable design language, figure out how to simplify the current information architecture, and essentially uplift the feeling of using enterprise software in this category—and ship it in about four months time. Not an easy feat, but for sure a compelling opportunity if done right: higher retention rates, more upgrades, higher customer lifetime value, and new clients. All of these would not only increase the bottom line of the business but also dramatically add more jobs in our ecosystem, which would encourage more job seekers sign up for Apploi.</p>

  			<p><em>Project Truman</em>, as it would be called, would be the first step in creating a healthy double-sided market/job ecosystem. It’s essential that we focus on the client side and work on our product to encourage more jobs to be entered in the system first, because it doesn’t rely on traditional network effects (like Facebook or LinkedIn), but more on a demand-side economies of scale (like Uber).</p>

  			<hr/>

  			<p>Since we’re not creating a product from scratch but doing a redesign of the system but also making it easier, it was imperative that we use the old product, do research on how it’s currently being used by customers, and figure out how we can make things simpler visually and functionally. In this case, it has to become an editing process, before it becomes an additive process.</p>

  			<p>This case study will:</p>
  			<ol>
  				<li>Explain the intent of the application</li>
  				<li>Identify issues with the old dashboard while explaining how the product works</li>
  				<li>Rationalize the solutions as a response to these issues both from a visual design and a user experience perspective</li>
  			</ol>

  			<h2>What does Apploi do? or, Why Should People Pay For It?</h2>

  			<p>Apploi, to put it simply, is a job ecosystem that serves and connects businesses who need the right people, and job seekers who need jobs. On the enterprise side, which was the focus of this project, businesses can create jobs that would be pushed to our ecosystem that seekers can instantly apply for.</p>

  			<p>These jobs aren’t just the standard ones with a job description, qualifications, and responsibilities published on a regular job board; instead, businesses can add questions templates that job seekers answer (in the form of text, video, audio, and others), acting as an initial screen to get an immediate and better grasp of the candidate’s initial fit.</p>
  			<p><strong>This process makes the application process faster and easier for both sides</strong>: no need for job seekers to ask in-store for an application form, and submit it with a resume and cover letter. Subsequently, no need for businesses to go through tons of paper resumes, do phone screens, schedule interviews, and always have to look for leads. The reduction in complexity is massive, and both sides can focus on what matters most: getting a job, and getting the right candidate for the job.</p>

  			<p>Thus, on the client side, businesses would be able to create jobs to be posted on Apple’s job board, see the jobs they posted, see the applicants who applied to their jobs, and do other tasks that would help in sourcing the right candidates.</p>

  			<h2>Dashboard Landing Page</h2>

  			<h3>Previous Landing Page</h3>

  			<img class="image" src="assets/truman/1.png">

  			<p>Aesthetics aside, the biggest issues with the old design were navigation, states, and actions. It was very difficult to map where you are in the system, which makes it confusing to the user how the system works as a whole (or what it’s supposed to do), and there were no prominent signifiers for actions to take (buttons, icons, delineation of links, etc.). But somehow, because HR tools are so behind especially in the retail, hospitality, and customer service space, there were paying clients big and small. Thus it was easy to rationalize that anything that would make their process efficient (especially because they tend to get tons of applicants but hard to find which are the best ones) would be a magnitude better than the current status quo.</p>

  			<p>So, in essence, it’s one thing to give the dashboard a modern look with typography and a different color palette, but a completely different challenge to create a dashboard that’s easily understandable and seems familiar from the outset: our job is to make people understand the product’s job-to-be-done clearly and concisely, give them the confidence that they can easily use it themselves, and continue to find and reap tremendous value from it.</p>

  			<p><strong>Fundamentally, we wanted people to understand that Apploi is the best way to find the right candidates in retail, hospitality, and customer service industries: it’s quicker, easier, and takes a lot less time and effort over the standard model while also being engaging for both parties to use.</strong> We wanted this to be the HR tool they have been dreaming of, and can’t live without.</p>
  			
  			<p>Going back to the design, we wanted better system mapping, signifiers on what you can do, and a visual language that helps you comprehend what is happening. Because a hiring manager can easily grasp the capabilities of the system, the gulf of execution is lower, and the more they interact with the product doing tasks with no hassle.</p>

  			<h3>New Jobs Landing Page</h3>

  			<img class="image" src="assets/truman/2.png">

  			<p>Led by our chief product officer, we wanted a dashboard that can infinitely scale, meaning, adding new functionality in the future would not increase the complexity of the system image, and having tons of jobs and/or applicants won’t be a hassle in trying to comprehend the product. We want it to seem familiar from the get go.</p>

  			<p>On the visual side, we introduced a new color palette that’s friendlier and more subdued, but one can still delineate links and actions. For type, we used Neutraface for navigation and column titles, and Open Sans as the body text for readability that’s easy on the eyes.</p>

  			<p>The most prominent solutions on the UX side:</p>
  			<ul>
  				<li>Stripped navigation system with indicators of where you currently are.</li>
  				<li>Revamped table of Jobs with more useful metadata (when the job was posted, who posted it, how many applied to that job and how many were new), and being able to act on each job easily without leaving the dashboard (for example, if you wanted to delete or edit a job, you had to go inside that job).</li>
  				<li>Having an overstated button which suggests the primary action on that page.</li>
  			</ul>

  			<h2>Create a Job Page</h2>

  			<p>Given that creating a job is the most prominent action in the entire product, we had to streamline the process. Pre-made job descriptions can be instantly added or created. You can attach media that would make that job more appealing (videos about the job, photos of the store, etc.), add a question template that the applicant would answer when they apply, other information that would help the applicant get a better feel of the job (Is it full-time or part-time? Is this in retail or hospitality?), and details more pertinent to the team (When does this job expire? Who else can see/update this job posting?)</p>

  			<img class="image" src="assets/truman/3.png">

  			<p>A finished job posting would look something like this:</p>

  			<img class="image" src="assets/truman/4.png">

  			<h2>Question Templates</h2>

  			<p>Question Templates are basically a set of questions that users must answer when they apply for your job posting. You can post different question types and require them to answer in a variety of ways (text, video, audio, scale, schedule, and signature). By introducing these quick questions in conjunction with their basic information, it’s advantageous for the seeker because they get to show their personality and have a chance to stand out early in the process, and the hiring manager can get a better grasp of the candidate beyond the standard resume.</p>	

  			<p>The old designs are below. In all honesty, I’m not sure how anyone was able to use it before. It’s loaded with tons of bells and whistles without making it clear what the function was at all, or why it’s a good thing to have. This is a particularly big problem in software: when you bloat the interface to the point it discourages use and comprehension even if theoretically it may have been in your best interest to use it.</p>

  			<h3>Old Question Template Flow</h3>

  			<p>Choosing the type of template:</p>

  			<img class="image" src="assets/truman/5.png">

			<p>Adding questions:</p>

			<img class="image" src="assets/truman/6.png">

  			<p>Adding automatic scoring.</p>

  			<img class="image" src="assets/truman/7.png">

  			<h3>New Question Template Format</h3>

  			<img class="image" src="assets/truman/8.png">

  			<p>Explanation of scoring/auto-acrhiving candidates:</p>

  			<img class="image" src="assets/truman/9.png">

  			<p>Choosing a question type and answer type:</p>

  			<img class="image" src="assets/truman/10.png">

  			<p>In this case, the question is text, which the hiring manager can fill. And the answer is supposed to be a video the candidate records which they can answer as long or as short as they want (no limit).</p>	

  			<img class="image" src="assets/truman/11.png">

  			<p>It would essentially act like this:</p>
  			<img class="image" src="assets/truman/11.1.gif">

  			<p>Some components:</p>
  			<ul>
  				<li>Instead of having confusing mapping, we created a landing page for Question Templates with similar structure as the Jobs Landing page: simple grid, added metadata, primary button.</li>
				<li>As for actually creating a question template, instead of having a multiple and complex process, we wanted to put it all in one page:</li>
					<ul>
						<li>explain auto-archive/scoring mechanism</li>
						<li>be able to add or delete questions as they please, but only when they want to,</li>
						<li>introduce actions that make more sense: they add a question, or if they’re done, they can save the template and add it on to a job.</li>
					</ul>
  			</ul>

  			<h2>Applicants Landing Page</h2>

  			<p>Note: I tried but couldn’t find a better image of the old Applicants Landing Page than the one below.</p>

  			<img class="image" src="assets/truman/12.png">

			<p>On the applicant side, some of the previous problems existed as well. There wasn’t much of a coherent grid that makes things easy to comprehend, and act on. Every system takes investment of some sort to learn, but reducing it to known patterns and seamless arrangement helps to register to a user what is happening and what they can do. And if they don’t understand something instantly, they can explore it without fear of losing where they currently are in the system.</p>

			<img class="image" src="assets/truman/13.png">

			<p>For the new design, we wanted to show which applicants were new/haven’t viewed yet. On the same table, we wanted to have a quick way to rate applicants manually. The scoring system here, is algorithmic, which works based on requirements you set when creating the job. The stages, which is made simpler here, is used to quickly show and navigate what stage of the application process the candidate is on.</p>

  			<p>But similar to the Jobs Landing Page, use of a grid, added metadata, and even just using colors on the grid and on the type helps tremendously in being able to parse information, and being able to act on the content (rate applicants from the table itself, be able to add notes, etc.)</p>

  			<p>Rate Applicants</p>

  			<img class="image" src="assets/truman/13.1.gif">

  			<p>Add Notes to Applicants</p>

  			<img class="image" src="assets/truman/13.2.gif">

  			<h2>Applicant Review</h2>

  			<p>Aside from creating jobs, reviewing candidates that applied is likely where hiring managers would spend most of their time, assuming people applied to their listing. This is essentially the most rewarding part of the experience.</p>	

  			<p>They get the candidate’s basic information and how they answered the employer questions/question templates.</p>

  			<img class="image" src="assets/truman/14.png">

  			<p>Today, this looks more closer to this:</p>

  			<img class="image" src="assets/truman/15.gif">

  			<h2>Company Profile</h2>

			<p>To convince applicants, we also introduced company profiles that hiring managers can use as a marketing channel for candidates to find out more about the company, such as locations, mission, and other types of media:</p>

			<img class="image" src="assets/truman/16.png">

  			<h2>Admin Pages</h2>

  			<h3>My Account Page</h3>

			<img class="image" src="assets/truman/17.png">

			<h3>Managing Subscription (since changed completely)</h3>

			<img class="image" src="assets/truman/18.png">

			<h3>Managing Team Members</h3>

			<img class="image" src="assets/truman/19.png">

			<p>Each of these have their own granular tasks and actions, but they also reflect the initial premise we set out for the Job Landing Page: clear grids, added metadata, primary buttons, and easier navigation and mapping.</p>

			<h2>Conclusion</h2>

  			<p>These are just the main pages, but there are a lot more actions and feedback interactions baked into the product. From where the product was before to where it was when initially shipped, it’s a complete drastic change. Every single user test was deemed a positive, whether from a hiring manager who’s never used Apploi before, all the way to clients who use Apploi at a higher level to manage hiring on a district/regional level.</p>

  			<p>It increased engagement from current users because, by sheer design, the newer product clearly communicates its potential/perceived value. This results in new business, more upgrades, partnerships with integrations, and more jobs in the ecosystem which means more job seekers on the supply side. Shortly after the product was shipped, we not only validated our proposition, the results went beyond our hypotheses both on a quantitative and qualitative standpoint, and it became the foundation of our dream to have an ecosystem that gets stronger over time.</p>
