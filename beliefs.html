				<li><strong><em>Economic growth</em></strong> is imperative for the peace and prosperity of our civilization.</li>
				<li>We must dare to create new things if we want economic growth. <strong><em>Technology</em></strong> that leads to significant productivity gains, wealth, and employment is an extremely important driver of economic growth.</li>
				<li>To build new technology at scale, we need to <strong><em>widen opportunity, mobility, and access</em></strong> for as many people to be able to contribute. There is no limit to man’s creativity therefore the more people that can build technology, the more there will be economic growth.</li>
				<li>“For as many people” means including and especially <strong><em>underrepresented communities</em></strong> whose diverse experiences, perspectives, and skillsets can only add to a richer sphere of technological possibilities, more intelligent discourse, and more active participation from the population.</li>
				<li>The future won’t design itself. Those who have vision and ability to create it have a <strong><em>moral obligation</em></strong> of doing so, setting up the next generation of builders to propel further economic growth that has a lasting impact on society's trajectory long after they're gone.</li>
