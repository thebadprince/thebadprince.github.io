			<p>This list makes up my <strong>current</strong> operating system.</p>
			<p>It's based on experience, <a href="/library.html">accumulated knowledge</a>,  and shifting perspective. These are less absolute truths and more a distillation of what gives me purpose & motivation and how I arrived at my <a href="/index.html">mission</a>.</p>

			<h3>Why We Need a Better Future, and How We'll Build It Together</h3>

      <ol class="beliefs">
				<li><strong>Economic growth is imperative for the long-term peace and prosperity of humanity.</strong> It creates better standards of living, longer lifespans, lower mortality rates, and more general fulfillment. Lack of economic growth may result in the opposite and has serious ramifications for the future of the population.<a href="#section1" id="ref1"><sup>1</sup></a></li>

				<!-- This results in more trade and collaboration and less interpersonal and international competition, and thus less violence, crime, and war.  -->

				<li><strong>We must dare to create new things if we want economic growth that can advance humanity as a whole.</strong> Technology that leads to significant continuous productivity gains, wealth, and employment is an extremely important driver of economic growth. Progress made today can alter the trajectory of society tomorrow.<a href="#section2" id="ref2"><sup>2</sup></a></li>

				<!-- (That said, not everything needs to “change the world.” As long as it has value to a group of people, that's a welcome improvement.) Simply accepting the status quo or copying existing things will not create enough economic growth which can lead to a rise in unhealthy group, individual, and international competition. On one extreme you have innovation that advances humanity as a whole; on the other you have increased violence, crime, and war. I like the former. -->

				<li><strong>We must have the courage to work on hard valuable problems.</strong> This is what moves the needle on what's possible. This is what largely creates meaningful economic growth that coincides with greater sustainability, happiness, and long-term vision for the future.</li>

				<li><strong>We need to widen opportunity, mobility, and access to serve as many people as possible.</strong> Diverse experiences, perspectives, skill sets, and interests helps solve a wider range of problems. This can only add to a richer sphere of technological possibilities, more intelligent discourse, and more active participation from the population. There is no limit to man’s creativity, therefore the more people that can build technology and build <em>with</em> technology, the more potential for economic growth there will be.</li>

				<li><strong>We need tools to empower and promote genuine individuality.</strong> Individuality tied to a strong purpose enables man's greatest contribution.</strong> It helps people connect with their character, their gifts, their potential, and their art instead of strictly catering to the ego and obvious rewards which are ephemeral in nature and create skewed incentives. A more enlightened individuality can lead to greater economic, creative, and psychological freedom.</li>

				<li><strong>The best leaders have a palpable energy about them that is infectious, confident, and inspiring.</strong> They have real skill, ambitious vision, strong strategic decision-making, and relentless execution. They are focused on tangible progress and on what they can give more than what they can get. They have are driven by the long-term and bring others with them for the ride. But it is their energy that sets the tone for everyone else.</li>

				<li><strong>Work ought to be meaningfully challenging.</strong> We find deep purpose in giving our best and making things happen in spite of how difficult they may be. Business books and thought leaders say many things on how to develop organizational culture, but winning—sustainably, ethically, and strategically at the right things—is the most important factor. And winning, and staying a winner, requires doing challenging things.</li>

				<li><strong>Maniacal focus is an underutilized competitive advantage.</strong> Everyone knows focus is good but few truly have the capacity, the discipline, and the patience for laser-like  focus. It requires one to be obsessively strategic about which paths to take, which actions have the greatest leverage, and what different things you'll do or what things you'll do differently from others. It’s about having a strong conviction about where you’re going and how you’re going to get there despite any criticism you may face or loneliness you may experience.</li>

				<li><strong>Taste is the great equalizer.</strong> You can have the most capital, the most distinguished pedigree, the most connected network, even the biggest brand, but there is still one thing none of those things can simply get: taste. Taste is a deep instinctual understanding of humans—what drives them, how they work, how they feel—and creating things that evoke a powerful want and need, matched with how it will work in the real world. It may take time for the market and society to catch up to that taste, but you can feel good taste when you see it.</li>

				<li><strong>We must build tomorrow today.</strong> The future won’t design itself. Those who have vision and ability to create it have a moral obligation of doing so to create a better society. It also sets up the next generation of builders that can contribute to humanity's peace and prosperity. We have to look forward and actively build the future.</li>

			<p id="section1" class="footnote"><strong><span class="footnote_number">&#xE149;</span></strong> I've seen firsthand what lack of economic growth looks like while growing up in the Philippines. It's better today, but there was—and still, to some extent—significant income disparity, widespread corruption, underinvested infrastructure, and poor healthcare &amp; education systems (unless you can afford it which is very expensive) reducing faith in the country's economic prospects in the future. This results in civil unrest and valuable human capital searching for better lives elsewhere, as was the case for my family. <br><br> In more extreme scenarios, declining economic growth leads to violence, crime, and war. This is why healthy economies are necessary. Without peace and prosperity, humans are focused strictly on survival and less on higher order things like human welfare, purpose, potential, imagination, and innovation. <a href="#ref1">↩</a></p>

			<p id="section2" class="footnote"><strong><span class="footnote_number">&#xE140;</span></strong> Building truly new technology requires patience because new things take time to get built, get right, and get adopted. You can do absolutely everything to push something into existence and manufacture user adoption but systems will still have a delay to respond to change. Thus why having the stomach for the long-term is just as important as the ability to move fast. <a href="#ref2">↩</a></p>
