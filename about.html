		<div class="description">

		<h3 class="description">Born and raised in Manila, Philippines. Grew up in Yonkers, New York. Lover of design, strategy, technology, and the humanities.</h3>

		<p>Design is my life. I drew rockets, cellular phones, home blueprints, and basketball shoes when I was a child. I was lucky enough to attend a technical school at a young age to learn the fundamentals of electrical engineering, information technology, and industrial drafting. When we moved to the U.S., that energy turned into graphic & web design, theater, and poetry.</p>

		<p>In university, I studied English & journalism—two things I'm still very passionate about—and learned storytelling while designing on the side to make money. I combined my love for technology and storytelling to move into marketing and advertising, then later into digital product design.</p>

		<p>Today, I constantly study and think about how design can create better products, better teams, and better businesses. Design can indeed make a huge difference in the world and I strive to make that happen in whatever capacity I might have.</p>
