		<h2>Designer /// Artist /// Obsessive</h2>

		<p id="start" class="animated fadeIn">Born in <span class="light">Manila, Philippines</span> in 1990.</p>
		<p>Goes to a <span class="light">technical school</span> at age 10 to learn fundamentals in information technology, industrial drafting, electrical &amp; mechanical engineering.</p>
		<p>Moves to <span class="light">Yonkers, New York</span> at age 14 where the <span class="light">creative arts</span> becomes his emphasis: acting, dancing, and <span class="light">graphic</span> &amp; <span class="light">web design</span>. Gets early freelance gigs for non-profits, aspiring musicians, and local organizations.</p>
		<p>Goes to study <span class="light">English</span> &amp; <span class="light">Journalism</span> in Albany, New York. Joins a fraternity and within the first year as a member, creates the national blog, art directs several widespread social campaigns, successfully expands into a new university, and becomes its first public relations chairman.</p>
		<p>After college, reads “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Smart-People-Should-Build-Things/dp/B00XWCZ1S4" target="_blank">Smart People Should Build Things</a>” and becomes inspired to <span class="light">join a local startup</span> building productivity tools for creative professionals.</p>
		<p>In 2015, becomes a <span class="light">product designer</span> working on consumer and enterprise software for the job search &amp; HR industry.</p>
		<p>In 2016, joins <a href="http://condenast.com"target="_blank">Condé Nast</a> as a designer on the Co/Lab team to pursue his personal mission in <span class="light">shifting the culture</span> through media and publishing.</p>
		<p>Outside of his day job, he runs an <span class="light">experimental design studio</span> focused on projects in the intersection of art, technology, design, culture, and commerce.</p>
		<br>
		<p>—</p>
		<br>
		<p><span class="lowercase">The universal theme to his work and thinking is:</span></p>
		<h3><a href="https://thebadprince.svbtle.com/the-ultimate-adrenaline-rush" target="_blank">the pursuit of mastery and shared humanity.</a></h3>
		<p><span class="lowercase">As a lifelong and largely self-taught student, his insatiable curiosity and genuine love for learning has been instrumental to everything he has done so far and is yet to do. He believes in doing things that are scary, risky, bold, and open for criticism &amp; vulnerability. After all, in this inevitable saunter towards death, <em>the only thing that matters is how we make people feel.</em></span></p>
