The Philippines for birthing me.
The City of Yonkers for raising me.
Cam'Ron for teaching me New York slang.
New York City, the best city in the world.
Tom of MySpace for essentially giving me a career without me even knowing it.
Nu Alpha Phi for giving me a foundation.
Sam Tran, Ed Fernandez, Michele & Frank Spiezia, Tom Gebauer, Cortney Cassidy, and Brooke Ellis for giving me a shot.
Everyone I have worked with in the past and everyone I will work with in the future.

			<h1>Solve Problems Through Software.™</h1>

			<section class="summary">

				<!-- <h2 class="title">Product Strategist<br>Designer<br>Hacker</h2> -->

				<p>My name is Jomi Cubol.</p>

				<!-- <p>A perpetual optimist passionate about the intersection of technology, economics, philosophy, and culture.</p> -->

				<p>I'm a product strategist, designer, and engineer.</p>

				<p>My mission is to democratize opportunity through technology to drive <a href="/beliefs.html">long-term economic growth</a>.</p>

				<p>Most recently, I worked at <a href="http://condenast.com" target=_blank>Condé Nast</a> where I designed digital products, led teams, and helped build a universal design system for all of its brands (including <a href="http://gq.com">GQ</a>, <a href="http://vogue.com">Vogue</a>, <a href="http://glamour.com">Glamour</a>, <a href="http://newyorker.com">The New Yorker</a>, and <a href="http://vanityfair.com">Vanity Fair</a>, among others) serving a global online audience of more than 120 million people every month. Before that, I designed mobile apps and enterprise software for startups.

				<p>I went to the University at Albany where I studied English and Journalism with a focus on the future of media.</p>

				<!-- <p>building modern recruitment and application platforms and tools for creative professionals.</p> -->

				<!-- <p>I went to the University at Albany where I studied English and Journalism with a focus on the future of media. Prior to college, I went to high school in Yonkers, New York where I cultivated my passion for the arts, dance, theater, writing, and design. I moved from Manila, Philippines where I grew up studying information technology, technical drafting, and mechanical & electrical engineering from an early age.</p>

				<p>I love to ask questions no one is asking, imagine new and exciting possibilities, create powerful solutions to challenging problems, build technology that accelerates progress, and lead and inspire others to do the same.</p> -->

				<p>I’m always looking for people who think and act long-term, combine the futuristic with the humanistic, and want to create a positive impact on society at scale.</p>

				<p>If you fit that description, get in touch. Where we go from here is a choice I leave to you.</p>
